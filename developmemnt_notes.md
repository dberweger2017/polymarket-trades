# These are notes that I make during development

## Currentley im deciding what models and providers I want to use for the llm and de embedding, the easiest would be open ai api, since with a single api key and place to top up balance they offer both. I wanted to use deepseek but deepseek still doesnt offer an embeddigs api. 

### OPTION A: Open ai api for both
### OPTION B: VOYAGE API. More work because 2 providers but cheaper and better. I want to test out voyage so will use this for embeddings and openai api for the models
